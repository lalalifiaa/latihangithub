#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World???????" << endl;
    return 0;
}
// This simple C++ program prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It includes the iostream library for input and output operations and uses the standard namespace to avoid having to prefix standard library names with "std::". The main function is the entry point of the program, and it returns 0 to indicate that the program ended successfully.
